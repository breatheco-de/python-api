## Step 1: Fork this Repo

To be able to debug, troubleshoot, or create new features for this repo, you will have to start by forking the repository.

This will create a version of the repo in your github repositories section that you will be able to work on before submitting a pull request.

## Step 2: Issues Cards

The main way to contribute is to tackle pending issues. This could be Bugs, Feature Requests, Documentation Updates, etc.

However, it's also important to report new issues.

If you need to post a new issue, please follow the guidelines in the `ISSUE-TEMPLATE.md` file.

## Planning and Suggestions

It will also be important to suggest new directions for the boilerplate in terms of integrations and a evolution of the project as a whole.

If you would like to contribute in this way, create a new issue and make a suggestion. At the present time, the project is small and as such there is no need for a slack. In the future, if popularity grows, we will create a channel for discussion as well.

## Documentation Updates

Every healthy repo needs good, well maintained, and concise documentation. If you are interested in updating the documentation, you have two things you can do to get started...

1. Explore the code and check the docs to see if we can add or clean up the existing documentation. (Before starting new cards, please check that there are no pending cards for your change in issue tracking already)
2. Tackle existing issue cards that request specific documentation changes.

If you plan on creating new documentation changes that are not related to an existing issue card, you will need to create a new card for tracking. Documentation changes must then be reviewed and approved before they can be merged.
